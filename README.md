# Markdown review week four.

### Terminal Learning objectives.
- creating functions & variables
- functions with parameters
- Booleans
- if and else statements


## creating functions & variables 
Creating functions is a staple skill of modern coding. Often overlooked because so many already exist that we can rely on to do almost anything we need. Yes we can use it, but do we UNDERSTAND it? That is the details we went into this week. Learning that functions are a set of instructions and variables are things we use to store values needed to run those instructions. Its not as crazy as it sounds! I promise! We will talk a bit more about functions in a moment below.

## Boolean values
Boolean values! Most of us have heard this word in some fashion or another. Named after its creater George Boole. A rather famous mathematician from the middle 1800s. He wanted to use logical reasoning symbols instead of words, faster, more efficient! Which lead to the brilliant 0, 1. Now it might seem silly to think having only 2 options is a lot. And youre right a 0, 1... thats not a lot. We have bits, bytes, megabytes, gigabytes etc. All of that adding up seems like a lot to us! However binary is so powerful when working together with other sets. Boolean basically removes all the fluff and says yes or no? On or off? 0 or 1? We use those a lot in the next section known as if and else statements!

## If else statements 
Okidokie then IF you read that little binary snippit up there ^ you may be giggling.... ELSE you just went back to to check it out! If else statements aren't quite so simple, they can be direct to achieve a specific goal. Or extremely convoluted to get the same outcome. We use if else statements when we want to check for something then do or do not as yoda says. These are extremely useful and powerful and can be nested and combined with several other data types, structures and functions to create a coding powerhouse stitched together by the tips of your fingers dancing across your keyboard!!!

A person wants to buy alcohol, the question. How old are they? 15, is 15 greater than or equal to 21? yes or no? true or false? no it is not. So tell that kiddo no alkies for them!

function AlcoholAgeTest(age) {
    if (age >= 21)
        return "getcho licka"
    else return "go home child"

}
